## Domain vs. Model

A domain model is used in software engineering. It is a common tool for object-oriented programming languages like Java. A domain model is a representation of the organization's data, independent of the way the data is stored in the database.


The domain in a domain model is the collection of all of the objects in that system. This domain contains all of the data and a representation of how that data behaves and interacts with each other.

A class is any set of objects that behave in the same way or have the same properties.

A conceptual class is a thing, behavior, or object within the domain.

Attributes describe the class. They are the individual pieces of information you want to store about the classes.

Associations record the relationships between the conceptual classes.

Data Model

A data model is used in database design and development.

An entity is the basic construct in a data model.
