# Anaemic Model

### Word
Anemic, US => Anaemic, BR /əˈniːmɪk 

### What it refers
When you implement a domain model with logic-less data values, and 
you put all business logic about them inside services, your model 
is a anaemic-model. In fact in this case your value/object is week,
meaning that it is so passive and doesn't represent any logic of the
bussines.
