## Essential & Accidental Complexity
- [Accidental and Essential Complexity — Programming Word of the Day](https://medium.com/background-thread/accidental-and-essential-complexity-programming-word-of-the-day-b4db4d2600d4)
  - "Jon Harrop wrote about a project that took over 40 developers almost 15 years to write in C++. He managed to write the whole thing himself in about 3 months in F#. And his version worked better."
  - "Fred Brooks noticed this in 1986, and wrote about it in his amazing paper No Silver Bullet. He calls this inherent complexity of a problem essential complexity."
  - "Essential complexity is how hard something is to do, regardless of how experienced you are, what tools you use or what new and flashy architecture pattern you used to solve the problem."
  - "Essential complexity is a property of the problem you are trying to solve."
  - "While some complexity is inherent to the problem, we also bring our own complexity while writing the program. This is called accidental complexity."
  - "That’s also why it’s important to have juniors in your team. They have no bias, so their solutions are often better than what any senior could have done." (Fresh eyes, less Context; this is the place where ignorace is valueable; the less you know, the more fresh you are)
  - "But this concept doesn’t just have an impact on your work. It also explains a phenomenon in the industry as a whole. See, computers got much, much faster during the last 20 years, but programming didn’t. ... The reason for this is, Brooks argues, that we reduced accidental complexity so much that all we have left is the essential one. This is why we won’t see 10x improvements in the near future. ... Brooks said they were barking at the wrong tree. If we want to get better as an industry, we need to start being more systematical and thinking up front." (In other words, the hardware is optimised as it can be, but the real problem, our thinking and designing skills, is something which we still need to focus on it! this is the essential complexity in software industry with which we have to deal)
